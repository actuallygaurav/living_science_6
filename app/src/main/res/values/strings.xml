        <item>Question 1:~Name one stem that has food stored in it.~ANSWER:~Potato is an example of a stem that has food stored in it.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Are humans herbivores, carnivores or omnivores?~ANSWER:~Humans are omnivores as they consume both plant and animal products.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Some animals usually eat the dead bodies of other animals. What are they called?~ANSWER:~Animals that feed upon dead bodies of other animals are known as scavengers.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Some food chains end at herbivores. True or false?~ANSWER:~True. In case of herbivores with no natural predators, the food chain ends at the herbivore.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~The chemical substances in food that your body needs are called~ANSWER:~The chemical substances in food that your body needs are called nutrients.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Do all living things eat the same kind of food?~ANSWER:~No, all living things do not eat the same kind of food.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Name the sources from where we get the ingredients used in food.~ANSWER:~Following are the sources from where we get the ingredients used in food:\n(i) Plants\n(ii) Animals\n(iii) Earth</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Why are green plants known as producers?~ANSWER:~Green plants use sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce carbohydrates by the process of photosynthesis. Since, plants produce food for themselves, they are known as producers.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Name three plants and their parts that we eat.~ANSWER:~Example of edible plants are:~1. Banana: The fruit is edible. The centre of stem is also eaten. Less commonly, the flowers of the banana tree is also used as food.2. Carrot: It is the root of the carrot plant.3. Rice: The grains of rice that are eaten are the seeds of the rice plant.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~In what way is a scavenger useful to the environment?~ANSWER:~Scavenger consumes dead organisms and prevent them from accumulating in the environment, which may lead to the outbreak of diseases. Therefore, scavengers keep the environment clean. For example, termites consume the remains of dead plants, while vultures consume dead animals.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Why does a mosquito not have teeth?~ANSWER:~Mosquitoes rely upon a liquid diet of either sap or nectar from plants (male mosquitoes) or blood (female mosquitoes carrying eggs). Since mosquitoes do not consume solids, they do not have teeth.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~We get our food items from plants and animals. Do you agree? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~Yes, I agree that we get our food items from plants and animals. All the foods that we eat are either derived from plants such as fruits, grains, vegetables, nuts etc., or they are derived from animals such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese butter etc.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~How is honey made?~ANSWER:~Following are the steps involved in producing honey are:\n1. Field bees, fly out from the honeycomb to find flowers and blossoms. They fly from flower to flower and suck out the nectar using their specially adapted tongues. Nectar is stored in special sacs in their bodies.\n2. Once the field bees return to the honeycomb, the nectar they bring back is eaten by house bees, which add enzymes from their bodies to the nectar that turns the nectar into honey.\n3. The house bees then regurgitate (remove from their bodies by spitting out through their mouths) the honey, which is stored in the cells of the honeycomb.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Explain the difference between herbivores, carnivores and omnivores.~ANSWER:~The difference between herbivores, carnivores and omnivores are as follows:1111111111111111111111111111111</item>
        <item>Question 3:~What are the functions of food?~ANSWER:~The main functions of food are as follows:\n1. Food is a source of energy to the body. When we work with our bodies and perform activities like thinking, running, walking, jumping etc., we use the energy obtained from food.\n2. The nutrients contained in food help the body grow and also repair itself by replacing dead and worn out cells.\n3. The nutrients contained in food also help the body\'s immune system to safeguards the body against various diseases.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~What is a food chain? Explain with an example.~ANSWER:~A food chain is a sequence that shows how each living organism gets its food in a particular environment.\nExample:\nPlants grasshopper shrew owl\n1. In the food chain shown, plants prepare food from sunlight, using carbon dioxide from the air by the process of photosynthesis. Since, the plant produces its own food, it is a producer.\n2. The grasshopper eats the plants as food to get energy. It is therefore classified as a primary consumer.\n3. A secondary consumer such as a shrew eats the grasshopper. As a result, a shrew lies one level above the grasshopper in the food chain.\n4. The shrew in turn is food for a tertiary consumer such as an owl. In the example shown, the owl is at the uppermost level of the food chain.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~How are the teeth of carnivores different from those of herbivores?~ANSWER:~Carnivorous animals eat the flesh of other animals, while herbivorous animals eat plants. The teeth of carnivorous animals are adapted to tearing flesh and are usually long and sharp that serve an added function of puncturing vital organs and killing the prey. The teeth of herbivorous animals are adapted to cutting and tearing leaves from plants and then crushing them. Therefore, herbivores have sharp front teeth to enable them to cut leaves and flat teeth at the rear of their mouth to enable them to crush the leaves or other plant material that is usually quite tough and fibrous.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~What are parasites? Explain giving two examples.~ANSWER:~Parasites are organisms that depend upon other organisms for their food. The organism that a parasite depends upon for food is known as the host. The parasite is usually harmful to the health of the host and can even kill the host. Some examples of parasites are:\n1. The Cuscuta plant is a parasitic plant that grows on other plants and inserts its root like projections known as haustoria into the host plant to suck out nutrients from the host plant. The Cuscuta plant does not have well developed leaves and relies mostly upon its host for obtaining food.\n2. Mosquitoes, leeches and bed bugs are examples of parasites that survive on blood that they suck from humans and other animals. Since, these parasites live outside the body of the host, they are called ecto-parasites.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Both carnivores and parasites depend on other animals for food. In what way is a carnivore different from a parasite?~ANSWER:~Differences between carnivores and parasites111111</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Humans eat both plants and animals. Which teeth in humans are suitable for tearing flesh?~ANSWER:~Humans are omnivores and eat both plant and animal derived foods. Humans have canine teeth that are suitable for tearing flesh. However, canines are not well developed in humans as they are incarnivorous animals such as lions or tigers.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~A food chain consists of several organisms. Suppose one of the organisms in the chain disappears. What effect can this have on the other organisms in the food chain?~ANSWER:~If one of the organisms in the food chain disappears, then the entire food chain will collapse as the flow of the nutrition will get altered and that will eventually cause death of other organisms of that food chain that are at higher levels.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~You have read about food chains in this chapter. Each living thing is a part of multiple food chains â for example, grass is a part of the food chain: grass â grasshopper â frog â snake â eagle, and also of the food chain: grass â deer â tiger.\nAll of the interconnected and overlapping food chains in a habitat make up a food web.\nSee the given food web and answer these questions.\n1. From the food web, construct two different food chains, each with four links.\n2. If all the eagles were killed, what would happen to the number of\na. squirrels?\nb. earthworms?~ANSWER:~1. Food chain I -\nRoots âEarthwormsâSparrows âEagles\nFood chain II -\nBerries âFlies âFrog âEagles\n2. Eagles keep a check on the population of squirrels. If all the eagles are killed, the population of squirrels would increase tremendously. An increase in the population of squirrels mean large scale destruction of nuts, the products on which they primarily feed on.\nEagles also feed on sparrows and keep a check on their population as well. Killing of eagles means, increased population of sparrows. As, the population of sparrows would increase, so will their demand for food. They feed on earthworms and large scale consumption of these may result in the extinction of earthworms. Also, earthworms are called a farmers friend. In their absence, the agriculture would also be affected.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~In 1965, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave a simple slogan to the people of India â Jai Jawan Jai Kisan (Hail the farmer, hail the soldier).\nWhat value does this slogan show? Which other people in your life would you like to pay a similar tribute to?~ANSWER:~The slogan reminds us, that we should always value the contribution of a farmer and soldier. It emphasis on the fact that our existence is owed to these people. The other people in our life whom we can pay a similar tribute are our parents and teachers. They are the guiding lights who help us to understand the value of everything in our life.</item>

Goitre: It is caused by the deficiency of iodine.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Discuss the importance of roughage in our diet.~ANSWER:~Roughage is consist of undigestible carbohydrates found in fruits and vegetables and remains undigested in the entire digestive tract from mouth to anus. The roughage serves certain important\nfunctions:\n1. It helps the muscles of the digestive tract in the formation of stools.\n2. It prevents constipation and ensures proper bowel movement.\n3. A diet that supplies adequate roughage is thought to reduce the incidence of heart diseases, bowel cancers and irritation of the bowels.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~It is observed that constipation is common among people in the western countries who eat more meat and processed food than us. What can be the reason for this?~ANSWER:~Processed food and meats contain very little roughage. The lack of roughage leads to constipation in people who consume foods deficient in roughage such as meat, processed flour, white flour and breads etc.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~An overworked computer software engineer works on the computer the whole day. He gets very tired after work. Somebody advised him to eat more carbohydrates and fats to get more energy. Do you think this will help him? Why?~ANSWER:~A computer engineer works sitting at a place and he does not expend a lot of energy to work. In other words, his work is sedentary. In such case, consumption of carbohydrates and fats will cause him to put on weight and become obese. So, a diet rich in carbohydrates and fats will not be helpful, but may harm a sedentary worker like a computer engineer.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Will you remain healthy if you only drink milk? Why?~ANSWER:~Milk contains most of the nutrients required. Therefore, milk is an example of a balanced diet. So, we can remain healthy by consuming mostly milk. However, milk is low in calorific value, so it may be difficult to meet all the energy requirements from a milk diet.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Explorers going to the North or South Poles must carry green vegetables and fruit juices with them. Why is this necessary?~ANSWER:~Explorers travelling to the north pole or the south pole will travel for a long time without access to fresh fruits or green vegetables. Not getting fresh fruits or vegetables for long periods can cause deficiency diseases such as scurvy. To prevent this, explorers going on long journeys to the north pole or the south pole carry with them large stocks of green vegetables and fruit juices.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~A scientist prepared a table showing the percentage of protein, fat, carbohydrate and water in some food items. Unfortunately, he did not write the names of the constituents and labelled them as A, B, C and D.~ANSWER:~Explorers</item>
        <item>Question 1:~A large number of people in India, including children, do not get enough food to eat. For them, a balanced diet with all nutrients is a distant dream. On the other hand, you may have seen people attending parties filling up their plates with more food than they can eat and wasting the food. Do you think this is justified? What message would you like to give to such people?~ANSWER:~No, wasting of food in any manner is not justified. ÃWe should try not to waste food as that wasted food can fill the stomachs of many poor and hungry people. The best way to avoid wasting food in parties etc. is to take little amounts of things you want to eat. Once you are finished you can have another serving without wasting the food. This would ensure that the food does not get wasted.</item>

        <item>Question 5:~How is silk obtained?~ANSWER:~Silk is obtained from the cocoon of silk worms. The silk worms feed on mulberry leaves and each worm spins a continuous thread, which is nearly 800 meters in length, to make a cocoon. The cocoons are collected and boiled in water to kill the silkworms. The cocoons are then unwrapped to get silk fibre, which is then woven into fabric.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~How is jute fibre made from the jute plant?~ANSWER:~Jute fibre is obtained from jute plant by the following steps:\n1. Retting: Jute fibre is obtained from the stalks of the jute plant. After harvesting, the stalks of jute plants are bundled together and soaked in water for about 20 days.\n2. The fibres are then separated from the stem in long strands and washed in clear, running water\n3. The fibres are then spread out or hung up to dry for between 2â3 days.\n4. The dried fibres are then collected and bundled to be sent to the mills to be processed into fabric, ropes, gunny sacks etc.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Wearing many layers of cotton clothes will keep you as warm in winter as wearing a thick woollen sweater. Why?

Thinkâwhich property of iron can be used for this?~ANSWER:~To separate the constituents of the mixture we can use the following steps:\n1. The first step is to pass the mixture through a filter paper. This will separate out a mixture of sand and iron filings from the salt solution.\n2. Now, pass a magnet over the mixture of sand and iron filings. The iron filings will be attracted to the magnet.\n3. Finally, evaporate the salt solution and collect the vapours. Condense the vapour to get water, while salt will be left behind.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~A mixture of salt and sugar is prepared by grinding them together. Do the molecules of the salt and sugar undergo any change?~ANSWER:~No, the molecules of salt and sugar remain as they are even when salt and sugar are crushed to make a mixture</item>
        <item>Question 4:~A saturated solution of sugar in water is prepared. The temperature of water is lowered by 5 Â°C. Will the solution continue to be saturated? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~If a solution is saturated, it means that more solid will not dissolve in the solution at that temperature. If the temperature is lowered, then the solubility of sugar will be reduced even further and the solution will continue to remain saturated.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Sea water has salt dissolved in it. You know that pure water can be obtained from sea water by distillation. However, this method is not used to get drinking water from sea water. What do you think is the reason?~ANSWER:~Sea water has salt dissolved in it and pure water can be obtained by distillation. However, the energy required to heat large quantities of sea water to make this process widely applicable is too expensive. Also, the condensers required are very expensive if they are to be sized large enough to distill vast quantities of sea water. As a result, distillation is not used to get drinking water from sea water</item>
        <item>Question 1:~In a factory, holes need to be drilled in steel to manufacture car parts. While doing this, the drill and steel get very hot due to friction and this can damage both. To solve this problem, a mixture of oil and water is sprayed onto the drill bit. The mixture acts as both a coolant and a lubricant. At the end of the process, there is a waste mixture of fine steel bits, dirty oil and water. To avoid wastage and pollution, it is advisable to separate the waste mixture and reuse the components.\nAnswer these questions.\n1. Suggest two methods of removing the bits of steel from the waste mixture in order to recycle them.\n2. How can the oil and water be separated?~ANSWER:~1. We can remove the bits of steel from the waste mixture in order to recycle them:\n(i) By filtration\n(ii) By using a magnet\n2. Oil and water are two immiscible liquids. They form two separate layers in solution, the oil comes on top of solution and water remains on the bottom of the surface. By simply pouring the oil from the container, we can separate water and oil.</item>

        <item>Question 1:~Every change has a cause. True or false?~ANSWER:~True.\nA substance continues to remain either in its physical state or chemical state until and unless it is acted by an external factor like heat, motion, wind etc. So, every change has a cause.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Every change can be classified as either physical or chemical. True or false?~ANSWER:~True.\nSometimes a change in a substance may result in the formation of new substance and sometimes may not. Depending on this, every change can be classified as either physical or chemical.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Is dissolving sugar in water a physical change or a chemical change?~ANSWER:~Sugar dissolving in water is a physical change. The sugar can be obtained back by evaporation of water and the water by condensation of water vapour.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Is change of state of physical change or a chemical change?~ANSWER:~The change of state of a substance does not involve the formation of new molecules. A change in temperature or pressure can reverse the change in state. Therefore, a change in state is a physical change.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Most chemical changes cannot be easily reversed. Such changes are called ___________changes.~ANSWER:~Most chemical changes cannot be easily reversed. Such changes are called irreversible changes.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Is changing of milk into curd a reversible change?~ANSWER:~No, changing of milk is not a reversible change. When the milk changes into curd, the molecules of the milk undergo change resulting in the formation of curd.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~Can you get burnt paper back to its original form?~ANSWER:~When a paper is burnt, the molecules of paper undergo change forming new substances like smoke and water vapour. The change here is irreversible. So, a burnt piece of paper cannot be brought back to its original form.</item>
        <item>Question 8:~Substances expand on heating. Is that a physical change or a chemical change?~ANSWER:~Substances which expands on heating, regain their original shape on cooling without forming any new substances. This change is a physical change.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Give one example for each of the following types of changes:\n(a) physical changes.\n(b) chemical changes\nÂ© reversible changes\n(d) irreversible changes~ANSWER:~(a) Physical changes:\nExample: Change in the size of the pencil or eraser with continuous use.\n(b) Chemical changes:\nExample: Burning of wood.\nÂ© Reversible changes:\nExample: Salt dissolving in water.\n(d) Irreversible changes:\nExample: Curdling of milk.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~A potter shapes pots out of clay. He then bakes the pots in an oven. Identify the reversible and irreversible changes taking plance in the process.~ANSWER:~A potter shapes pots out of clay. This is a physical change which can be easily reversed. During this change, only the shape of the substance changes, without any change in the texture of the clay.\nThe potter then bakes the pots in an oven that makes the clay to becomes hard and brittle. Thus, there is a change in the internal structure of clay which makes soft clay hard and brittle. This is a chemical change which is irreversible.\n</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Breaking of a glass tumbler and burning of paper are changes in which we cannot get back the original substances. What is the difference between these two changes?~ANSWER:~Breaking of glass tumbler Burning of paper PENDING</item>
        <item>Question 4:~What kind of change is cooking of food? Why?~ANSWER:~Cooking food is an irreversible, chemical change. During cooking, the molecules that are present in food changes to form new substances. Also, cooked food cannot be reverted to the raw state.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Do you agree with the statement \'all physical changes are reversible\'? If not give the correct statement.~ANSWER:~No, there are some physical changes which are irreversible. For example, tearing of a paper. When a paper is torn, the size and the shape of the paper changes, but the molecules of the paper remains the same. Since, no new molecules are formed, tearing paper is a physical change. At the same time, we cannot get back the sheet of paper from the pieces. Thus, the physical change is irreversible.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Growth is increase in size. Is it a physical or a chemical change? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~Growth results in increase in size due to the intake of food. The food consumed by a living organism, is absorbed by the body and is used to nourish the cells for growth. Therefore, this is a chemical change, which includes the formation of new substances during the process of growth.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Explain the difference between physical and chemical changes, giving one example of each.~ANSWER:~Physical change Chemical change PENDING</item>
        <item>Question 2:~\'One way changes are classified is reversible and irreversible\'. Explain with examples.~ANSWER:~Consider the example, when salt is mixed with water. The salt dissolves in water forming a solution. The salt can be obtained back by the evaporation of water and water by condensation of the water vapour. Such changes which can be easily reversed are called reversible changes. Consider the example of rusting of iron. When an iron is kept in humid air for some days, a brown substance (rust) deposits on it, which has very different properties from that of iron. There is no simple way to get back the iron from the rust. Such changes which cannot be reversed are called irreversible changes.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~What is a chemical reaction? Explain with an example.~ANSWER:~A chemical reaction is the process by which reactants react with each other to yield products. In chemical reactions, the reactant molecules are completely different from the molecules of the products formed. Example: Take some washing soda and mix it with water in a bottle. After making sure that the washing soda is fully dissolved in the water, add a few drops of lemon juice to the contents of the bottle. Hold a lit match stick near the mouth of the bottle. You will see that the match is extinguished showing that the gas produced is carbon dioxide.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Give one example to show that when substances are mixed, it may result in a chemical or a physical change depending on the conditions.~ANSWER:~When substances are mixed together, it can result either in a physical change or a chemical change.\nExample: If iron and sulphur are mixed, no chemical change occurs. But when the mixture is heated, it glows after some time and a black substance is formed which is different from iron and sulphur.\nSo, heating a mixture of iron and sulphur results in a chemical change.\nSimilarly, when sugar and water are mixed together, sugar dissolves completely in water. No new substances are formed during the change. The sugar and water can be obtained back from the solution.\nThis is a physical change which can be reversed.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~When a candle burns, both physical and chemical changes occur. Explain.~ANSWER:~When a candle burns, wax in the candle melts and is then vaporised as it is drawn up the wick. Melting and vaporisation are physical changes. The wax vapours then burn at the wick to leave behind soot and water vapour, while emitting heat and light. The burning of wax vapours is a chemical change. Thus, wax undergoes both physical and chemical changes when a candle burns.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Tearing of paper is irreversible. It is, therefore, a chemical change. Do you agree? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~The tearing of paper is an irreversible change as we cannot get back the original sheet of paper from the pieces. However, there are no new substances created by tearing paper. The pieces of paper obtained have the same molecules as the original sheet of paper. Thus, tearing of a paper sheet is a not a chemical change, but it is a physical change.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~A potato remains a potato even after it is cooked. Therefore, cooking is a physical change. Do you agree? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~When a potato is cooked, heating the potato cause changes in the molecules of the potato. Therefore, upon cooking, the potato does not remain the same at a molecular level. Thus, cooking is a chemical change, not a physical change.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~When sugar dissolves in water, it disappears. That means it must have changed into a new substance. Therefore, dissolving is a chemical change. Do you agree? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~When sugar dissolves in water to form a sugar solution, the sugar disappears. However, the molecules of sugar remain intact and are distributed uniformly in the water. Also, the water molecules are not changed when sugar is dissolved in water to form a sugar solution. We can easily get back the sugar by evaporation of water from the sugar solution. The evaporated water can then be condensed to recover the water also. Hence, it is a physical change and not a chemical change</item>

        <item>Question 1:~Explain with an example what is meant by living things respond to stimuli.~ANSWER:~Living things respond to changes in their environment. For example, if you touch the leaves of the Mimosa (touch-me-not) plant, the leaves droop. In this case, the plant is responding to the stimulus of touch by drooping its leaves.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~How do living things grow? Some non-living things also grow. How is their growth different from the growth of living things?~ANSWER:~Living things grow by the division of cells. Unicellular organisms such as Amoebae grow by an increase in the size of the single cell that makes up the organism. Non-living things grow by the addition of material from outside. For example, a pile of sand will grow if more sand is added to it.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~List three ways in which living things reproduce, giving one example of each.~ANSWER:~Three ways in which living things reproduce are:\n1. Some living things produce buds which grow into new organisms. For example, potatoes produce buds, known as eyes which grow into new potato plants.\n2. Mammals such as humans give birth directly to young ones.\n3. Some snakes, birds and crocodiles lay eggs and the young ones hatch from the egg.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~List four different ways in which organisms carry out exchange of gases for respiration, with one example of each.~ANSWER:~All living organisms exchange gases with the environment. The means are as follows:\n1. Fishes respire using their gills.\n2. Earthworms use their skin for respiration.\n3. Insects such as cockroaches breathe through several tracheal tubes in their bodies.\n4. Humans and many other animals such as cows, goats etc. respire through external nostrils, which supplies air to their lungs.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Explain phototropism and geotropism in plants. Are there any similar examples in the animal world also?~ANSWER:~If a plant is potted near a window, its stem will bend toward the light as it grows. The growth of a plant towards light is known as phototropism. In the same way, the roots of plants grow towards the earth and the stem grows in the opposite direction. This is an example of geotropism.\nIn animals, cockroaches and earthworms show negative phototropism. They move away from light. In the same way, Paramecium swims in the opposite direction of the Earths gravity and shows negative geotropism.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Explain giving examples what you mean by a species.~ANSWER:~Each type of living organism has many individuals which are broadly similar to each other. Individuals may differ slightly but their behaviour, habits or appearance are quite similar. Such a group constitutes a species. Members of a species inhabit the same environment, eat the same kind of food and reproduce among themselves.\nFor example, all pigs are a species, humans form a species, oak trees are a species of trees etc.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide during respiration all the time. Why do we then say that plants supply oxygen to the air?~ANSWER:~During the day, plants use carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis and give out oxygen. The amount of oxygen given out by a plant during photosynthesis far exceeds the amount of oxygen consumed by the plant and converted into carbon dioxide by respiration. Therefore, we say that plants supply oxygen to the air.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~A car eats fuel, breathes air, excretes smoke and moves from place to place. Why is it not considered to be living?~ANSWER:~A car is not living because:\n1. A car is not made up of cells. It is made up of the atoms and molecules of steel, plastic, etc.\n2. A car does not grow.\n3. A car cannot respond to stimulus.\n4. A car cannot reproduce.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Are living things matter?~ANSWER:~All living things have a mass and they occupy volume. Therefore, all living things are matter.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Why does the population of animals living in jungles not increase as quickly as the human population does?~ANSWER:~In jungles, there are many pressures for survival. The most important of which is finding of food and water. Humans have managed to domesticate animals, farm for food crops, vegetables and fruits and harness rivers to provide water. Thus, humans have very little limitations in terms of food and water. Further, humans have access to medical care to cure diseases that may kill animals in the jungle. As a result, human population increases much more quickly than the population of animals living in jungles.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Cells are made up of molecules. Why then do we say that the structural unit of a living thing is a cell, and not a molecule?~ANSWER:~Living organisms show specific characteristics such as growth, response to stimulus and other life functions. The cell is the basic unit which shows all the life functions. However, molecules do not show the basic life functions. Molecules are the ingredients of life, but they are not alive, cells.\nAs a result, the cell is the unit of a living being.</item>

        <item>Question 1:~Is a small mango plant a herb? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~A small mango plant cannot be categorised as a herb because the stem of even a small mango plant will be brown and hard which usually show a characteristic of the stem of a tree. This characteristic also indicates that the plant is still in the stages of growth, and has not attained the complete growth.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Some flowers are not pollinated by insects but by wind. Do you think such flowers are as attractive as insect-pollinated ones?~ANSWER:~The wind pollinating flowers are usually small, dull coloured and are scentless. Thus the insects are not attracted towards such type of flowers. The pollen grains in such type of flowers will be large in number and are dusty, so that they can be easily carried away by the winds. When both types of flowers are compared, the wind pollinated flowers are less attractive than the insect pollinated flowers.</item>

        <item>Question 4:~In a habitat, which are expected to be greater in numberâherbivores or carnivores? Why~ANSWER:~In a habitat, herbivores are expected to outnumber carnivores. This is because carnivores depend upon herbivores for their food and get energy by consuming herbivores. Some energy is wasted during the transfer from herbivores to carnivores. Consequently, less energy exists at the level of a secondary consumer. This leads to a reduction in the number of carnivores compared to herbivores.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~All organisms including bacteria and fungi feed on dead plants and animals. Then why are only bacteria and fungi known as decomposers?~ANSWER:~Bacteria and fungi break down the dead bodies of plants and animals and return the nutrients back to the soil. This is not the case with other organisms such as scavengers. For example, if a vulture eats a dead animal, the vulture uses the nutrients in its body and the nutrients are not returned to the soil. Since, bacteria and fungi return the nutrients back to the soil, they are known as decomposers.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Choose the most appropriate~answer.~1. What is the main reason why monkeys do not live in a grassland habitat?\na. There is not enough water for them.\nb. There is not enough food for them.\nc. There are very few trees.\nd. They cannot hide in the grass.\n2. What is the main reason why humans do not live in a sea habitat?\na. There is not enough food.\nb. There is no fresh water.\nc. It is difficult to build a house there.\nd. It is too cold.~ANSWER:~1. Monkeys are animals which are usually found in tropical rainforests due to the dense vegetation found there. Monkeys are adapted to living on trees, for example, they have strong arms to swing from one tree to another. On the other hand, in grassland ecosystem the area is covered with grasses and grass like plants. It is suitable for grazing animals. These areas are deficient in the number of trees which means the availability of food for monkeys also becomes a reason why they are not found in grasslands.\n2. Humans cannot survive in a sea habitat due to non-availability of fresh water. Humans require fresh water for their survival and they cannot survive in its absence. Sea water has high concentration of salt and this water can neither be consumed nor used for any other process.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Sandeep is used to an air conditioner in his room. He visited his grandparents who did not have an air conditioner. Sandeep was unhappy and grumbled the whole time. His grandparents felt very bad. Do you think Sandeep was right in behaving in this way? What would you have done? We often do not get the comforts of life that we become used to. But we should be able to adapt to such conditions and remain happy.~ANSWER:~Sandeep was wrong in his behaviour. He should not have behaved in such an irresponsible manner and should have behaved responsibly. His behaviour was disheartening for his grandparents. He should have understood that we should try to be happy in what we have instead of cribbing about things we do not have. He should learn to adjust to his surroundings. I would have never behaved in this manner and rather would have cherished all the moments that I would spend with them. I would be interested in knowing how people lived there without these modern facilities and what ways they adopted to beat the heat. I would have loved to have long talks with my grandparents and enjoy some stories.</item>

        <item>Question 1:~Which of theseâa completely transparent object or a translucent objectâwill form a shadow? Will the shadow formed by an opaque object be darker or lighter than this shadow?~ANSWER:~Among completely transparent and a translucent object only a translucent object will form a shadow. Shadow formed by an opaque object will be darker than a translucent object. This is because an opaque object will completely block the light, while translucent will allow some light to pass through it and not completely block out the light..</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Can an object form two or more shadows at the same time? How?~ANSWER:~Yes, an object can form more than one shadow at a time. If an object is illuminated from more than one direction by lights, we can have more than one shadow. For example, if you are lit from two different directions, you will see two shadows..</item>
        <item>Question 3:~What will be the colour of a shadow formed in red light?~ANSWER:~The colour of a shadow formed from red light source will be black in colour if the object is completely opaque..</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Does a pinhole camera form an image or a shadow of an object? Justify your answer.~ANSWER:~A pinhole camera forms an image of an object. The image is the region where light coming from the object is focussed by the pinhole on to a screen. The image formed by a pinhole camera is inverted compared to the object, but it has the same colour as the object. In addition, the image has all the details of the object. Hence, we can confirm that a pinhole camera forms an image, not a shadow..</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Can a pinhole camera form an image which is biger than the object? If yes, explain with a diagram.~ANSWER:~Yes, a pinhole can form an image which is bigger than the object. Observe the figure below. As the distance d between the screen and the pinhole increases, the size of the image formed by the pinhole camera increases..</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Professor Photon is a scientist. He is designing a rocket to take him to the sun. His colleague Professor Spark tells him that he and the rocket will burn out when they reach near the sun. Professor Photon has an answer to this - he says that he will launch the rocket so that it reaches the sun during a total solar eclipse. Is Professor Photon\'s logic correct? Give reason.~ANSWER:~No, Professor Photon\'s logic is incorrect. Because during a solar eclipse, the sun remains as it is, only the path of the light rays coming from the sun is blocked by the moon. When the professor will reach nearby the sun there will not anything that can block the sunlight coming from the sun. Hence, he will surely burn out along with his rocke.</item>

        <item>Question 1:~What is an electric circuit?~ANSWER:~An electric circuit is an arrangement which provides a way for the flow of electric current in it. It is a device which comprises of components such as electric cell, switches, bulbs and wires.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~When is an electric circuit said to be closed?~ANSWER:~An electric circuit is said to be closed or complete when there is flow of electricity through the circuit. When the two ends of a cell are connected to a bulb using metal wires, the bulb emits light. The bulb glows due to flow of electric current from the positive terminal to the negative terminal through the filament of the bulb. Such a circuit is called a closed circuit.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Why can electricity not flow in an open circuit?~ANSWER:~An open circuit is one in which one of the metal wires is disconnected from the cell. When the metal wire is disconnected, there is no path for the current to flow. Hence, electricity cannot flow in an open circuit.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Why is an electric cell needed in an electric circuit?~ANSWER:~An electric cell is needed in an electric circuit because it is the source of electrical energy in a circuit. The energy provided by the cell drives an electric current in the circuit.</item>

        <item>Question 4:~Instead of plastic, can the electric wires at home be coverd with aluminium foil? Justify your~answer.~ANSWER:~The covering of an electric wire is made of plastic because plastic is an insulator, which does not allow current to flow through it. As a result, a person touching the wire is saved from getting shocked. If instead of plastic the wire is covered with aluminium foil, it can be dangerous as the aluminium foil is a conductor and can conduct electricity and lead to shocks.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~What is a solar cell? Give two uses of solar cells.~ANSWER:~A cell which directly converts the light coming from the sun into electrical energy is known as a solar cell.\nUses:\n(1) A collection of solar cells is used as a source of power for satellites launched into space.\n(2) In isolated places where there is no electricity, solar cells supply power to the street lights and water pumps.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Where is the electricity used at home generated? How does it reach out houses?~ANSWER:~Electricity used at home is generated from large power generating stations. Electric current produced from the these stations flows to the substations and then reaches our homes through thick wires on poles known as overhead wires (power lines). In some countries, the power lines can also run underground.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~A student, while making a circuit to make a bulb glow using a dry cell, connected the plastic covering of the wire to the cell, instead of the metal wire inside it. Will current flow in the circuit? Why?~ANSWER:~No, the current will not flow in the circuit. For the current to flow in the circuit, the metal wires should be connected to the cell and not the plastic covering. Plastic is an insulator which obstructs the current flow. Therefore, it should be ensured that only the metal portions of wires are connected to the cell because metals are good conductors, which allow the easy flow of current in the circuit.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Why do you think electric wires are made out of copper or aluminium though silver is a better conductor of electricity?~ANSWER:~We know that silver is a very good conductor of electricity but it is a very expensive metal. Aluminium and copper are nearly as good conductors of electricity as silver but they are much cheaper. Therefore, electric wires are made of copper or aluminium.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~A bare wire carrying an electric current can give you an electric shock. Based on this, can you say if your body is a conductor or an insulator?~ANSWER:~The human body is made up of more than 70% water, and is a good conductor of electricity. As a result, you will get a shock when you come into contact with a bare, current carrying wire.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~As a safety measure, you are advised to wear rubber slippers or shoes when handling electrical appliances. Why?~ANSWER:~Electrical appliances carry large amounts of electrical current. Human body is a good conductor of electricity and current can easily pass through the body to the ground leading to electric shocks. Hence, it is advised to wear rubber gloves, slippers or shoes when dealing with electrical appliances as rubber acts as an insulator and breaks the circuit to the ground. This prevents current from flowing through the body.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Current in a circuit flows from the positive terminal of a cell to the negative terminal. In which direction does the current flow inside the cell?~ANSWER:~In a circuit, electric conventional current flows from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal. You can think of this as a positive cell moving from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal. Once the positive charge reaches the negative terminal, it moves inside the cell from the negative terminal, back to the positive terminal. Therefore, conventional current is assumed to flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal inside the cell.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Why are only solar cels used as a source of power in satellites?~ANSWER:~Satellites are artificial machines which orbit around celestial bodies to gather information or for communication. Satellites get their power from solar panels. A solar panel is a collection of solar cells which generates electricity directly from the light of the sun. As long as a satellite gets sufficient sunlight, it will keep producing enough electricity to power its onboard systems and there is no need to replenish batteries, which cannot be done easily once the satellite is launched.</item>

        <item>Question 1:~Why does a freely suspended magnet point in the northâsouth direction?~ANSWER:~A freely suspended magnet always points in the northâsouth direction because earth behaves like a huge bar magnet. The geographic north pole of the earth is the magnetic south pole and the geographic south pole is the magnetic north pole.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~What will happen to the poles of a magnet if it is broken into two?~ANSWER:~When a magnet is broken into two, the resultant is two separate magnets. Each resultant magnet will end up with its own north and south pole. This shows that poles exist in pairs and there can never be an isolated north or an isolated south pole.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Will a strong magnet attract a piece of copper? Why?~ANSWER:~No, a strong magnet will not attract a piece of copper because copper is not a magnetic metal.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~State the rule for attraction and repulsion between two magnets.~ANSWER:~Rule of attraction of magnets states that "when a south pole of a magnet is brought close to the north pole of another magnet, they attract".\nRule of repulsion of magnets states that "when a north pole of a magnet is brought close to the north pole of another magnet, they repel".</item>
        <item>Question 5:~One precaution you should always take while handling a magnet is not to drop it. Why?~ANSWER:~One precaution you should always take while handling a magnet is not to drop it because when magnets are dropped down to the floor, the impact of the drop weakens their magnetism.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Why are magnetic keepers used to store magnets?~ANSWER:~A magnetic keeper is a piece of wood or soft iron which is used in storing magnets because bar magnets get demagnetised when the poles are left free for a long time. In order to preserve the magnetism of the magnets, a keeper is kept across a pair of bar magnets with unlike poles beside each other. This way a continuous path is provided for the magnetic field lines to form a loop around it.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~How will you experimentally show that there are two regions in a magnet where its magnetic strength is concentrated?~ANSWER:~Magnetic strength of a magnet is concentrated at the two regions namely the poles of the magnet. To show this, take a bar magnet and roll it up in a sheet of iron filings. When we lift the bar magnet, we observe that the iron filings do not stick uniformly over its length rather, the iron filings cling to the two ends of the magnet. There are however a few in between but none in the centre of the magnet. From this experiment we can conclude that the magnetic strength is strongest at the two regions which are the two ends of the magnet, known as the poles.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Show diagrammatically two ways in which a magnet can be freely suspended to locate directions.~ANSWER:~A magnet can be suspended freely to show direction either as a suspended bar magnet or as a pivoted needle mounted in a glass box.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Give the step-by-step method you will adopt to test if a piece of magnetic material is a magnet.~ANSWER:~To test whether a magnetic material is a magnet or not, the following procedure can be adopted.\n1. Take a metal bar.\n2. Bring one pole of a bar magnet to one end of the bar at one time and observe.\n3. If it is observed that one end of the metal bar is attracted to one pole and the other end is repelled, it is confirmed that the metal bar is a magnet.\n4. If it is observed that both the ends of the bar are attracted, then the metal bar is not a magnet.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that repulsion is a certain test for magnetism</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Given a bar magnet, describe the method you will use to magnetize an iron nail.~ANSWER:~An iron nail can be magnetised by a bar magnet by a process of single touch method. In this method, one pole of a bar magnet is used to stroke the iron nail held firmly on a surface. Stroke the iron nail from one end to the other and after reaching the other end, lift the magnet and repeat the process by bringing it back to the first end again. After about 30 strokes, you will observe that the iron nail has become a magnet when suspended freely. If the iron nail has been stroked by north pole at the first end, that end becomes the north pole while the other end becomes the south pole.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Name and describe the instrument that uses a magnet to find direction.~ANSWER:~A magnetic compass is an instrument which is used to find directions. A magnetic compass consists of a magnetic needle fixed to a point in it and is made to rotate freely about that point. When there are no other magnetic materials in its vicinity, the needle points in the northâsouth direction. In this manner, it can be very useful to the sailors to determine directions.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~List any three uses of magnets.~ANSWER:~Following are the uses of magnets:\n1. Automobile dynamos to produce electricity\n2. Computer hard discs to store information\n3. A compass to determine directions.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Before invention of the compass, sailors used stars to find directions. In what way is using a compass better?~ANSWER:~A compass is a better way of locating directions because it has a magnetic needle fixed to a point which is free to rotate about that point. We know that a freely suspended magnet always rests in the northâsouth direction in alignment with the earthâs magnetic north âsouth poles. East and west are the directions which are perpendicular to the northâsouth. This way sailor can accurately find the directions and need not depend on the stars.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Will a pair of bar magnets, with keepers on the two ends, act as a magnet? Try out and see for yourself.~ANSWER:~Yes, a pair of bar magnets with keepers on two ends will act as a magnet. A keeper is a soft iron or steel piece which when kept across the poles of the magnet behaves like a temporary magnet. It helps in conserving the magnetism of the magnets by providing an uninterrupted path for the magnetic field lines to form a loop. Since, there is magnetic field, a pair of magnets with stoppers will act as magnets also.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Maglev train is a type of train that moves while floating in air just above its track. This way friction is minimized and the train moves very fastâat speeds exceeding 500 km per hour. How do you think it is made to float above the rails?~ANSWER:~Maglev trains float above the rails because in these trains, the conventional wheels of the train and the tracks on which they move are replaced by magnets. It is the repulsion property of these magnets which make the Maglev trains float over the tracks. As the train begins to move, the two magnets repel each other as like poles repel. When the magnets repel each other, train is held above its track and as the friction is minimised, the train can reach very high speeds.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Given a bar magnet, how will you find tthe west direction?~ANSWER:~A bar magnet when suspended freely, always points in the northâsouth direction. Once the north and south directions are known, the direction of west and east can be easily found. West and east are the directions which are perpendicular to the north-south. West direction is towards the left of the north direction.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~A company that made scientific instruments designed a magnetic compass shown here, and sold it in the market. However, customers complained that the compass did not show that direction correctly. The company tested the compasses and found that the needle did not point in any one direction. On further testing, it was properly magnetized and freely pivoted. They could not understand what was wrong. Can you?~ANSWER:~The needle of magnetic compass points in the north-south direction provided it is not in contact with another magnet or other magnetic materials. The company found the needle freely pivoted and properly magnetized but still it was not able to show the direction properly. The reason behind is that the container of the given compass is made of steel, which is a magnetic material. The magnetic behavior of the steel is disturbing the magnetic behavior of the compass, that\'s why it is not able to show the direction properly</item>

        <item>Question 2:~Name the forms of water as it occurs in nature in the three states.~ANSWER:~Water occurs in nature in solid state as ice, in liquid state as water and in gaseous state as water vapour.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~\'Evaporation of water occurs at all temperatures.\' How is evaporation dependent on temperature?~ANSWER:~Evaporation of water occurs at all temperatures. As the temperature increases the rate of evaporation also increase.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Why does water vapour condence when it reaches high up in the atmosphere?~ANSWER:~The air gets cooler as it goes higher in the atmosphere. Because of the cooler air, the water vapour gets condensed when it goes higher in the atmosphere.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~When water vapour condence, it forms tiny drops of water that form clouds. When do these droplets come down as rain?~ANSWER:~Water vapour condenses to form tiny droplets that form clouds. If there are dust particles in the clouds on which the water droplets can settle and get bigger, then the droplets will eventually become large enough to fall as rain drops.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~How can you change\n(a) water to ice?\n(b) ice to water?\n(c) water vapour to water?~ANSWER:~(a) Water can be changed to ice by reducing the temperature. This is known as freezing of water.\n(b) Ice can be changed to water by heating it. This is known as melting of ice.\n(c) Water vapour can be changed to water by cooling the water vapour. This is known as condensation.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~How are natural springs of water formed?~ANSWER:~The ground water which passes along the surface of the non porous rocks, however, at some places come out on the surface, forming a natural spring.</item>
        <item>Question 8:~Give any three important uses of water.~ANSWER:~Following are the uses of water:\n1. Water is extensively used for all domestic purposes like drinking, washing, cooking etc.\n2. Water is one of the important mediums of transportation.\n3. Water a source of energy to produce electricity.</item>
        <item>Question 9:~What do you mean by the \'water cycle\'?~ANSWER:~The cycle which involves the constant circulation of water from earth to atmosphere, and again back to the earth is called as water cycle.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Why is water so important for out body?~ANSWER:~Water is important for our body because of the following reasons:\n1. Water is a major constituent of all bodily fluids such as blood and plasma.\n2. Water is essential for digestion of food, absorption of food and also excretion of wastes from the body.\n3. Water is useful to cool the body and regulate temperature. When it is hot, we sweat from our skin.\n4. A correct concentration of salts is maintained by water, which makes conduction of nerve impulses possible.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~In what ways is water useful to plants?~ANSWER:~The utility of water to plants is as follows:\n1. Water is required for the germination of seeds, their growth and development.\n2. The roots of the plants absorb water from the soil. Along with carbon dioxide and water, plants prepare food in the presence of sunlight by photosynthesis.\n3. This food is transported to various parts of the plants by means of water.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~How can you show that water vapour is present in air?~ANSWER:~To demonstrate the presence of water vapour in air, take some ice cubes in a glass. Let the glass stand without being disturbed for some time. You will observe droplets of water on the outer surface of the glass. These water droplets result from the condensation of water vapour from the air on the cold surface of the glass. This shows that water vapour is present in air.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~What are the reasons for lowering of the water table in large cities?~ANSWER:~The water table in large cities has been lowered because of the following reasons:\n1. In large cities, trees have been felled to make room for buildings and roads causing less rainfall in large cities.\n2. In large cities, rain water is diverted by drains into lakes and reservoirs, rather than into the water table.\n3. The large population in big cities uses ground water and other water resources faster than they can be replenished.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~During a drought, the prices of grain, fruits and vegetables go up. Why do you think this happens? Do you expect the prices of grain, fruits and vegetables to go up during floods also? Why?~ANSWER:~Drought is a situation which occurs due to the shortage of rainfall.This results in drying up of crops, which in turn leads to the shortage of food. Hence, during drought, the prices of grains, fruits and vegetables increase. Floods are caused due to excess rainfall. Due to the excess water flow, the crops gets damaged again resulting in the shortage of food. Again, this causes an increase in food prices.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~What are the causes of floods?~ANSWER:~During monsoon season, most parts of our country receives heavy rainfall. The rivers which are perennial, receive a very large amount of water. This causes the rivers to overrun their banks and move towards land, causing floods. In coastal areas, floods are often caused by tidal waves, which occur due to cyclones.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~List four ways in which we can conserve water.~ANSWER:~Following are the ways by which we can conserve water and use it effectively:\n(i) Using the water effectively, by avoiding wastage and recycling wherever possible.\n(ii) Planting more trees and forestation. Trees absorbs water from the ground. Hence, balance the water cycle.\n(iii) Storing rain water in large amounts for future use by constructing dams.\n(iv) Treating the sewage and industrial wastes before disposing them to the water source, thereby reducing the water pollution.</item>
        <item>Question 8:~Big dams have their own problems. Discuss.~ANSWER:~Big dams have large water reservoirs to store a huge amount of water at a time. If the rainfall is heavy and the water exceeds the storage limit of the reservoir, then water is released from the dam. This causes heavy flooding, which destroys wildlife, agriculture and displaces people from their homes. Also, large amount of water stored in dams can cause earthquakes in regions prone to tectonic activity.</item>
        <item>Question 9:~What is rainwater harvesting? What are the two ways in which it can be done?~ANSWER:~Rain water harvesting is storing the rain water for future use. Rain water harvesting can be done in following two ways:\n(i) The rain water that falls on the roof of the buildings are directed towards a deep pit in the ground. In this way the ground absorbs the water and thereby adding to the underground water reserves.\n(ii) Instead of allowing the rainwater to flow into the drains, the rain water has to be directed to the underground pits to again boost ground water levels.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~What would have been the consequence if water was not recycled in nature by the water cycle?~ANSWER:~If water was not recycled in nature, then the water resources on earth gets depleted. This would cause an imbalance in nature, causing the extinction of life on earth.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~It is estimated that the water table in a fast growing town like Gurgaon (near Delhi) will go down so much in the next decade that it will be difficult to extract groundwater for use. This situation can be corrected by widespread use of one method of recharging groundwater. What do you think this method is?~ANSWER:~In fast growing towns like Gurgaon, ground water can be recharged by making use of rain water. The rain water that falls on the roof of the building and flowing along the roadside should be directed and allowed to flow into a deep pit in the ground. This water adds to the underground water.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~You can see water in its three states in nature. Name some other substances that you can see in the three states in everyday life.~ANSWER:~Water exists in its three states in nature. Other than water, we can also see wax existing in these three states. There are many more elements such as iron, helium, aluminium etc., which can be found in all the three states but under specific conditions of temperature and pressure.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Think of some simple habits you can develop in your daily life that can help in conserving water â for example, reducing the time you spend in the shower by 1 minute can save 8â10 litres of water every day.~ANSWER:~Some simple habits to save water are -\nClose the tap while brushing\nUse bucket to have a bath instead of a shower\nCheck for any kind of leaks\nClose the tap while shaving\nDo not wash the cars with running water\nClean cars, bikes and bicycles using waste water from AC\'s or water purifiers\nWashing the paths, walkways using waste water from AC\'s or water purifiers\nUse water used to wash vegetables for watering the plant</item>

        <item>Question 9:~Name the organ used by fishes to breathe in air dissolved in water.~ANSWER:~Gills present in fish helps them to breathe in air dissolved in water.</item>
        <item>Question 10:~The atmosphere is responsible for weather changes. True or false?~ANSWER:~True.\nThe changes in the weather occurs due to the atmosphere surrounding the earth.</item>
        <item>Question 11:~The __________ cycle gets disturbed by deforestation.~ANSWER:~The oxygen cycle gets disturbed by deforestation.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~What do you mean by \'atmosphere\'?~ANSWER:~Atmosphere is a layer or blanket of air surrounding the earth. It extends up to 1000 kilometres above the earth\'s surface.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Carbon dioxide is present to the extent of only 0.03% by volume in air. Why then is it considered to be so important?~ANSWER:~Though carbon dioxide is present in lesser amount, it is very essential for both plants and animals. Plants require carbon dioxide to prepare their food. All animals in turn depend upon plants either directly or indirectly for their nutrition.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~What is humidity?~ANSWER:~The amount of water vapours present in the air is called as humidity.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~What is the difference between breathing in and respiration?~ANSWER:~#PENDING</item>
        <item>Question 5:~How do fish breathe?~ANSWER:~Fish have gills, with the help of which they breathe in the oxygen present in water. The water containing the dissolved oxygen passes through the gills and the oxygen gets absorbed by the gills.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~Do plants require nitrogen? Why?~ANSWER:~Yes, plants require nitrogen because it is involved in the growth of the plant.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~What is the importance of the ozone layer in the atmosphere?~ANSWER:~Ozone layer is a protective layer of gases which is present in the upper atmosphere. This layer blocks harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun and prevents them from reaching the earth.</item>
        <item>Question 8:~When is air said to be polluted?~ANSWER:~Air is said to be polluted when the composition of different gases in the air is dramatically altered. Moreover, addition of gases that are not normally found in the air also leads to air pollution.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~What is the composition of air.~ANSWER:~Air is a combination of different gases. The major components of air are as follows:\n(a) Nitrogen - 78%\n(b) Oxygen - 21%\n(c) The remaining 1% consists of argon (about 0.9%), carbon dioxide (about 0.03%) and traces of other gases.\n(d) It also consists of water vapour, dust and smoke which varies timely from place to place.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Why is it considered unhealthy to breathe in through the mouth?~ANSWER:~If we breathe in through the mouth, the smoke and dust particles present in the air, enters directly into our respiratory system which is harmful and cause damage to our respiratory system. Hence, to avoid this, we must breathe through our nose, where these particles are filtered by the fine hairs and mucus present in nostrils.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Most plants have stomata on the undersides of leaves. However, water lily leaves have stomata on the upper surface. Why?~ANSWER:~Stomata are the small openings present underneath the leaves of the plants with the help of which plants breathe in air. In water lilies, the leaves float on the surface of the water. In such condition, if the stomata are present underneath, it would be difficult for them to breathe in oxygen. Hence, in water plants stomata are present on the upper surface.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~What is the oxygen cycle?~ANSWER:~Oxygen cycle is the movement of oxygen from the atmosphere to earth and vice versa. Plants and animals use oxygen present in the air for respiration. Oxygen is also used for combustion. This oxygen is replaced by the plants during photosynthesis. This cycle repeats balancing the volume of oxygen in the air.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~List any four uses of air.~ANSWER:~Following are the uses of air:\n(i) It helps in restoring the water balance in nature.\n(ii) It is used to generate electricity, with the help of wind mills.\n(iii) It helps in seed dispersal for pollination.\n(iv) It makes the flight of airplanes and helicopters possible.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~How does the atmosphere help to maintain the right temperature on the earth?~ANSWER:~Sun emits heat and light, a part of which is absorbed by the atmosphere and the rest of it is reflected back. This prevents the earth from getting too hot during the day time. Similarly, during the night time, the trapped heat in the atmosphere prevents the earth from getting too cold. In this way the atmosphere help to maintain the right temperature on the earth.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~List three steps we can take in our daily lives to reduce air pollution.~ANSWER:~The steps that should be taken to reduce air pollution are as follows:\n1. We should try to use public transport instead of personal transportation.\n2. More efficient fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) should be used because they produce less smoke.\n3. We should try to plant trees so that the extent of air pollution is reduced.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Can you think of one observation in your daily life which shows the presence of water vapour in the air?~ANSWER:~Rusting of iron is a best example to show the presence of water vapour in the air. When the iron interacts with the air, the water vapour present in the air undergo chemical reaction with the iron forming a reddish brown substance on the surface of the iron which is called as rust.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Is it good to sleep under a tree\n(a) during the day,\n(b) at night? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~During the day time the leaves of the trees give off a plenty of oxygen in the process of photosynthesis. The amount of oxygen given off far exceeds the amount of carbon dioxide given out by the process of the tree respiring. At night, there is no sunlight and photosynthesis stops. The trees however, continue to respire. As a result, trees give out carbon dioxide at night. Therefore, it is not advisable to sleep under a tree at night.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~People living in a certain region have a high incidence of skin cancer. Can you identify one possible cause for this?~ANSWER:~This may be due to the damage of ozone layer in that particular region. The sun emits ultraviolet radiation which can cause skin cancer. The ozone layer, present in the upper atmosphere, acts as a shield and protects the earth from these rays. If the ozone layer is damaged, then a large amount of ultraviolet radiation falls on the earth and can cause skin cancer if people are exposed to the ultraviolet radiation.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Why do you think air becomes thinner higher up? (HINT: think of which force holds the atmosphere to the earth)~ANSWER:~The gravitational force which attract every object towards the surface of the earth, also attracts the air, which makes the air denser on the surface of the earth. As the air moves up, i.e., away from the surface of the earth, the lesser gravitational force causes the air to be less dense or thinner.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~An aquarium owner, on a rather cold day, put a heater in his aquarium, which made the water warm, but not hot. He thought the fish would like that. However, all his fish died. What could be the reason for this?~ANSWER:~Air heats up and cools down faster than water. Even when the air is cool, the water is relatively warm. Since, changes in water temperature are never as severe as changes in the temperature of air, aquatic animals such as fish are very sensitive to small changes in temperature.When a heater is put into the water, it was not as cold as the air to begin with. The increase in the warmth of the water coupled with the high temperature sensitivity of aquatic animals led to the death of the fishes in the aquarium.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Four burning candles are covered as shown. Arrange them in decreasing order of the time for which they will continue to burn.~ANSWER:~The correct decreasing order for the given burning candles for the time for which they will continue to burn is as follows:\nCandle 4 - candle 2- candle 1- candle</item>

        <item>Question 2:~Why is there a need to segregate the two types of waste?~ANSWER:~There is a need to segregate the two types of waste because both the biodegradable wastes and non-biodegradable wastes require different methods of disposal.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Why do we say that composting results in \'recycling\' of biodegradable waste?~ANSWER:~Composting is a natural process of recycling the biodegradable waste because it reuses the nutrients present in the wastes and restores them to the soil, thus increasing the productivity of the soil.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~Why can compost not be made from nonbiodegradable waste?~ANSWER:~Composting is possible with the wastes which can decay by itself, like fruit and vegetable peels, leaves, flowers etc. Non biodegradable wastes will not decay by itself. Hence, compost cannot be made from non biodegradable wastes.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~What is vermicomposting?~ANSWER:~Vermicomposting is a method of yielding manure, in which the biodegradable wastes are decomposed with the help of red worms, which is a species of earthworm.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~How are metals recycled?~ANSWER:~Metals are recycled by smelting them to make fresh metal, which are then used to make other articles.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~What concerns does disposing off garbage raise?~ANSWER:~One of the greatest problems that the cities and towns are facing today is the disposal of the garbage. The garbage collected from the entire city or town is so huge that it can neither be disposed to the river as this causes water pollution, nor it can be burnt as this releases poisonous smoke and gases which causes harm to the living beings.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Why has recycling of nonbiodegradable waste become so essential these days?~ANSWER:~The use of plastic bags, packaged cans and other non biodegradable substances has been increased over a few decades. A major part of the garbage collected consists of these non biodegradable substances. Hence, it is very essential to recycle the non biodegradable wastes these days to reduce their accumulation in nature.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Why is recycling considered to be an efficient method of disposing off biodegradable waste?~ANSWER:~The process in which the waste materials are collected and processed to make new products for future use is called as recycling. Recycling of biodegradable wastes reduces the amount of wastes and helps to maintain the environment neat and clean. It also helps to restore the nutrients from the waste back to the soil.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~How can we reuse and recycle paper?~ANSWER:~Paper is a biodegradable waste which is made out of wood. Paper can be reused to make paper carry bags, for wrapping books, for making paper mache products, etc. Other than this, paper can also be recycled for future use. By doing so, we can reduce the accumulation of garbage and simultaneously conserve trees.</item>
        <item>Question 5:~Why are plastics such a cause of concern for the environment?~ANSWER:~Over a few decades, the use of plastics has been increased extensively and has become a cause of concern for the environment. Since, it is a non biodegradable substance, it can neither be thrown off nor can be burnt. In addition to this, the foodstuffs are getting contaminated due to the absorption of the dyes from the plastic bags.</item>
        <item>Question 6:~List five ways in which you can contribute to a better disposal of waste.~ANSWER:~Following are the ways by which we can contribute to a better disposal of waste:\n(i) Segregating the biodegradable wastes and non biodegradable wastes in separate dustbins.\n(ii) Composting the biodegradable wastes.\n(iii) Reducing the aggregation of plastic/metal cans and bags, replacing the plastic bags by jute bags and reusing the plastic/metal cans for storing things.\n(iv)Reducing the accumulation of paper either by reusing it or recycling it.\n(v) Recycling the non biodegradable wastes wherever necessary.</item>
        <item>Question 7:~What are the four Rs of waste disposal? Explain each in a sentence.~ANSWER:~The four Rs of waste disposal are:\n(i) Refuse: Say no to the non biodegradable wastes such as plastic bags, packaging cans, metal wastes, etc.(ii) Reduce: Decreasing the accumulation of wastes consuming less and throwing less.\n(iii) Reuse: Instead of throwing the substances as waste, reusing them wherever possible.\n(iv) Recycle: Recycling the wastes whenever necessary and possible.</item>
        <item>Question 1:~Why do we refer to earthworms as \'farmer\'s friends\'?~ANSWER:~Composting is a process where the biodegradable wastes are decomposed naturally and the nutrients are restored to the soil. Earth worms help in the process of decomposition by the process of vermicomposting. Since, they help to increase the productivity of the soil, we call them \'farmer\'s friends\'.</item>
        <item>Question 2:~Would you prefer to dispose off dry leaves in your garden by burning them or by composting them? Give reasons.~ANSWER:~Burning the dry leaves destroys the essential nutrients which can be restored to the soil and also causes air pollution by the release of smoke. Composting the dry leaves along with the other biodegradable substances, recycles the nutrients present in the leaves and restore them in the soil. In this way, the soil becomes more fertile. Hence, it would be a wise option to dispose off the dry leaves by composting them.</item>
        <item>Question 3:~Can you call a waste collector a \'friend of the environment\'? Why?~ANSWER:~A waste collector collects waste and sells it to the factories that further recycle or process the waste. In this way, a waste collector reduces the amount of waste in the environment and decreases the extent of environmental pollution. Thus, a waste collector can be considered as a friend of the environment.</item>
        <item>Question 4:~When we discuss about plastics as being a danger to the environment, we normally talk about plastic bags, and not other plastic products like TV cabinets, buckets, etc. Why?~ANSWER:~Plastic in the form of plastic bags are enormously used and thrown as waste materials into the environment. These when disposed off, block the drains and the soil, kills the animals when animals eat them and contaminate the foodstuffs. Hence, they cause harm to the living beings. The other plastic materials like TV cabinets, buckets are not frequently disposed off into the environment like plastic bags and are not as dangerous as plas</item>
